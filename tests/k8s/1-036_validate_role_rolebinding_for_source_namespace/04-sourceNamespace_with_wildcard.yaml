  # Previously this test used '*', however, this will cause intermittent failures in this test: when this test is run, other namespaces on the cluster may still be in the process of being deleted (e.g. they have non-nil '.metadata.deletionTimestamp'), and the operator code will fail on those namespaces if we use '*'.
