# OLM Install

The following steps can be used to install the operator using the [Operator Lifecycle Manager][olm_home] on any Kubernetes 
environment with minimal overhead.

## Cluster Setup

This guide uses [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/) to deploy a Kubernetes cluster locally, follow the 
instructions for your platform to install. If you already have a Kubernetes cluster ready to go, skip to 
the [OLM](#operator-lifecycle-manager) section.

Run minikube with a dedicated profile. Adjust the system resources as needed for your platform. 

```bash
minikube start -p argocd --cpus=4 --disk-size=40gb --memory=8gb
```

## Operator Lifecycle Manager

Install the OLM components manually. If you already have OLM installed, skip to the [Operator](#operator-install) section.

Either

- install OLM from [here](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/releases)

or

- install using the `operator-sdk` command
```bash
operator-sdk olm install
```

Verify that OLM is installed. There should be two new namespaces, `olm` and `operators` created as a result.

```bash
kubectl get ns
```

```
NAME              STATUS   AGE
kube-system       Active   7d1h
default           Active   7d1h
kube-public       Active   7d1h
kube-node-lease   Active   7d1h
operators         Active   94s
olm               Active   94s
```

Verify that the OLM Pods are running in the `olm` namespace.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n olm
```

```
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
olm-operator-5b58594fc8-bzpq2       1/1     Running   0          2m10s
catalog-operator-6d578c5764-l5f5t   1/1     Running   0          2m10s
packageserver-7495fbf449-w4w6h      1/1     Running   0          80s
packageserver-7495fbf449-9jmpj      1/1     Running   0          80s
operatorhubio-catalog-pnsc7         1/1     Running   0          81s
```

That's it, OLM should be installed and availble to manage the Argo CD Operator.

## Operator Install

Use the following steps to install the operator using an OLM Catalog.

### Namespace

Create a new namespace for the operator.

```bash
kubectl create namespace argocd
```

### Operator Catalog

Create a `CatalogSource` in the `olm` namespace. This manifest references a container image that has the Argo CD 
Operator packaged for use in OLM. For more information on packaging the operator, see the [development][docs_dev] documentation.

```bash
kubectl create -n olm -f deploy/catalog_source.yaml
```

The `catalog_source.yaml` file can be found [in the `deploy` folder in the
repository](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/tree/master/deploy).
It should look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: argocd-catalog
spec:
  sourceType: grpc
  image: quay.io/argoprojlabs/argocd-operator-registry@sha256:dcf6d07ed5c8b840fb4a6e9019eacd88cd0913bc3c8caa104d3414a2e9972002 # replace with your index image
  displayName: Argo CD Operators
  publisher: Argo CD Community
```

Verify that the Argo CD operator catalog has been created.

```bash
kubectl get catalogsources -n olm
```

```
NAME                    DISPLAY               TYPE   PUBLISHER        AGE
argocd-catalog          Argo CD Operators     grpc   Argo CD          6s
operatorhubio-catalog   Community Operators   grpc   OperatorHub.io   25m
```

Verify that the registry Pod that serves the catalog is running.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n olm -l olm.catalogSource=argocd-catalog
```

```
NAME                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
argocd-catalog-nxn79   1/1     Running   0          55s
```

### Operator Group

Create an `OperatorGroup` in the `argocd` namespace that defines the namespaces that the Argo CD Operator will watch for 
new resources.

Please find the file `operator_group.yaml` in the [git
repository](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/blob/master/deploy/operator_group.yaml).

It's content looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: argocd-operator
```

```bash
kubectl create -n argocd -f deploy/operator_group.yaml
```

Verify that the new OperatorGroup was created in the `argocd` namespace.

```bash
kubectl get operatorgroups -n argocd
```

```
NAME              AGE
argocd-operator   10s
```

### Subscription

Once the OperatorGroup is present, create a new `Subscription` for the Argo CD Operator in the new `argocd` namespace.

You can use the file [from the git
repository](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argocd-operator/blob/master/deploy/subscription.yaml), it looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: argocd-operator
spec:
  channel: alpha
  name: argocd-operator
  source: argocd-catalog
  sourceNamespace: olm
```

```bash
kubectl create -n argocd -f deploy/subscription.yaml
```

Verify that the Subscription was created in the `argocd` namespace.
```bash
kubectl get subscriptions -n argocd
```

```bash
NAME              PACKAGE           SOURCE           CHANNEL
argocd-operator   argocd-operator   argocd-catalog   alpha
```

The Subscription should result in an `InstallPlan` being created in the `argocd` namespace.

```bash
kubectl get installplans -n argocd
```

```
NAME            CSV                      APPROVAL    APPROVED
install-62hsr   argocd-operator.v0.1.0   Automatic   true
```

Finally, verify that the Argo CD Operator Pod is running in the `argocd` namespace.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n argocd
```

```
NAME                                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
argocd-operator-controller-manager-74b9ddb78c-lxzq2   2/2     Running   0          2m27s
```

## Usage

Once the operator is installed and running, new ArgoCD resources can be created. See the [usage][docs_usage] 
documentation to learn how to create new `ArgoCD` resources.

## Cleanup

You can clean up the operator resources by running the following commands.

```bash
kubectl delete -n argocd -f deploy/subscription.yaml
kubectl delete -n argocd -f deploy/operator_group.yaml
kubectl delete -n olm -f deploy/catalog_source.yaml
kubectl delete namespace argocd
```
