## Overview

[Argo CD Notifications](https://blog.argoproj.io/notifications-for-argo-bb7338231604) was merged into core Argo CD codebase as a part of the v2.3 release. The notifications controller is now available as an optional workload that can be configured through the Argo CD operator. 

## Installation

Argo CD Notifications controller can be enabled/disabled using a new toggle within the Argo CD CR with default specs as follows:

``` yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: example-argocd
spec:
  notifications:
    enabled: True
```

Users may also specify advanced configuration such as the number of replicas for the notifications controller, as well as the resource requirements for the same. The full list of available settings can be found in the [API spec](../reference/api.html.md#argoproj.io/v1alpha1.ArgoCDNotificationsSpec).

Notifications are disabled by default. Enabling notifications results in the operator creating the following resources on the cluster:

*  `<argocd-instance-name>-notifications-controller` deployment
*  `<argocd-instance-name>-argocd-notifications-controller` serviceAccount
*  `<argocd-instance-name>-argocd-notifications-controller` role
*  `<argocd-instance-name>-argocd-notifications-controller` roleBinding
*  `<argocd-instance-name>-argocd-notifications-cm` configmap
*  `<argocd-instance-name>-argocd-notifications-secret` secret

The operator creates the `argocd-notifications-cm` configmap which is populated with a set of default templates and triggers out of the box, in line with what is provided by the upstream Argo CD project. `argocd-notifications-cm` is editable to users, and will not be reconciled/overwritten by the operator. The `argocd-notifications-secret` is an empty secret that can be used to configure credentials for the supported notifications services.

Instructions for appropriate configuration of these resources can be found within [upstream documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/notifications/).


## Uninstallation

Argo CD Notifications controller can be disabled by setting `.spec.notifications.enabled` to `false` :

``` yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: example-argocd
spec:
  notifications:
    enabled: false
```
This will clean up all the aforementioned notifications-controller resources that were created by the operator.
